**Needed credentials:**

To log in, click on the user icon in the bottom right corner of the footer. The correct credentials correspond to real users in the database, which can be found in the Users list. In other words, using the email and username of any user should result in a successful login.

As an example, consider the user with ID #1:

```
- EMAIL: sincere@april.biz
- USERNAME: bret
```

Simply using these credentials should be sufficient to unlock administrator functions, such as deleting or creating posts.
